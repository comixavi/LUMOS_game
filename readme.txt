This project is a customizable, Observer-pattern-based game written in Java. You control the player character using either the arrow keys or the WASD keys, aiming to collect as many points as possible within a time constraint. The game map is randomly generated each round. As you progress, the difficulty increases with each level, adding more enemies or altering the number of available points.

Points are scattered around the grid, and each one increases your score when collected, and gives a little bit of extra time. The player can perform special actions, such as jumping, to avoid obstacles or reach points more effectively. After each level, the game dynamically adjusts the number of enemies and available points. The game can continue indefinitely as long as you stay alive and meet the time limit. To start the game, simply press the spacebar or click the button labeled with the game's name. The modular design of this game makes it easy to customize everything from player movement options to screen dimensions and enemy behavior.
